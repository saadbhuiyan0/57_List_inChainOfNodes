# represent a list as a chain of nodes

## workflow
* Develop the `Node` class incrementally, by
iteratively uncommenting the next minimum step
in `UserOfNode` and, in parallel, implementing the 
features it requires of `Node`.

* When you have a fully-featured `Node`, 
use the same workflow on `List_inChainOfNodes`.

## pictures rule
Four out of four comp sci teachers polled answered "yes" to...
>When you have a problem you think should be solved with 
linked nodes, do you draw a picture?

My picture for a list of 4 elements is
[in this repo](Stuy.png). But you would still
benefit from pictures of...

* an empty list
* the re-arrangement in the links required for a
particular step.

For whatever my experience is worth: I drew both
those pictures and consider that doing so saved me time.
